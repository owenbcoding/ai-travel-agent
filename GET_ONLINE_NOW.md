```

### Monitor Usage

- Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

### Custom Domain (Optional)
Want `travel.yourdomain.com` instead of `.streamlit.app`?
- Available on Streamlit paid plans ($20/month)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" during deployment
- Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Verify file is in root directory

### "API key not found" error
- Double-check secrets format in Streamlit Cloud
- No quotes around the key
- No extra spaces

### App is slow
- Free tier shares resources
- Consider Streamlit paid tier for dedicated resources
- Or optimize your CrewAI agents
